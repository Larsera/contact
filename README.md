As climate change and nature conservation becomes a larger part of our everyday life, we are in need of a better understanding of the processes in the nature. Sensor equipment and data communication has become both cheaper and more available in the recent years. We are in a Internet of Things revolution, and data gathering has never been easier.

On the other end of the data stream from the sensors, the data needs conditioning and analysis. The multi-dimensional data can be processed by machine learning algorithms and displayed in a more understandable format. We can also create a web-experience based on real-time data from the sensors.

This thesis will start the collection of data in a small scale, by using a set of basic sensors and an Arduino.  

# Data gathering 
Let's start in a small scale with a single plant.
The plant of choice will be the culinary herb Basil.
It's easy to get hold on from a grocery store, it's easy to work with, and it's a very active and thirsty plant.

## Sensory equipment (at the moment)
* Soil moisture
* Air temperature
* Air moisture
* Water temperature
* Light intensity
